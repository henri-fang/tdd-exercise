## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5

[source from](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## 2.Smallest multiple

[source from](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the
smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## 3.Palindrome checker

A string is said to be a palindrome if it is the same if we start reading it from left to right or right to left.

## 4. CalcStats

[source from](https://www.programmingwithwolfgang.com/tdd-kata)
Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics:

minimum value maximum value number of elements in the sequence average value For example: [6, 9, 15, -2, 92, 11]

minimum value = -2 maximum value = 92 number of elements in the sequence = 6 average value = 21.833333

## 5. OddEven

[source from](https://github.com/garora/TDD-Katas/tree/master/src#the-oddeven-kata)

Write a program that prints numbers within specified range lets say 1 to 100. If number is odd print 'Odd' instead of
the number. If number is even print 'Even' instead of number. Else print number [hint - if number is Prime].
- Definition of Even(偶数): Integers which are divisible by 2 are known as even numbers
- Definition of Odd(奇数): Integers which are not divisible by 2 are known as odd numbers
- Definition of Prime(质数): Every prime number is an odd number except number 2.

## 6.Recently used list
Develop a recently-used-list class to hold strings uniquely in Last-In-First-Out order.

The most recently added item is first, the least recently added item is last.
Items can be looked up by index, which counts from zero.
Items in the list are unique, so duplicate insertions are moved rather than added.
A recently-used-list is initially empty.
